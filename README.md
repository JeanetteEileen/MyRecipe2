# MyRecipe2
This is a simple WebApi meant to store personal recipes.  I started this so I would have an understanding of Foreign Keys when I worked on the Blue Badge Team project.
I wanted to be sure my code worked before I put anything in the team project.  
This simple API allows you to create a recipe, list ingredients, directions to make the recipe.  You can Post, Get, Put and View the recipes.
In addition, you can look up all recipes by the given sourceId.  The source refers to who or where you got the recipe.  If you wanted to see all recipes that you use from a 
given cookbook you could by looking up the cookbook by its sourceId.

I also experimented with adding some personalization on the API/help page.  This was my first effort to customize the help page.
